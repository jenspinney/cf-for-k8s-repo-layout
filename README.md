# cf-for-k8s-repo-layout
This is a repo demonstrating how the [cf-for-k8s repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s) is structured, as of summer 2020. The intended audience for this sample repo are contributors (or potential contributors) to the cf-for-k8s project. The goal of this repo is to see in a simpler project how [`vendir`](https://github.com/k14s/vendir) and [`ytt`](https://get-ytt.io/) are used by cf-for-k8s to bring different components together.
